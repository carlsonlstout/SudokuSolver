I wrote my check-ins in comments on my program files and was going to just worry about the GitHub at the end.
I was saving my changes to my folder on my device, so unfortunately, I don't have any commit changes or comments. 
I reread the rubric, and I see the error in my ways, as committing it would have shown what I was changing by the date. 
I copied them below and removed them from the project files before uploading. Check-ins were written a day before each, so the 15th, 22nd, and 29th as I 
had a reminder in my calendar, but I don't have the commits, so I understand if I miss out on the 6 points for version control

Check in 1 
Setup: I created a basic folder structure and placeholder files for SudokuSolver, SudokuGrid, and Cell classes.
I'm planning to implement file input, puzzle validation, and backtracking solver logic in upcoming commits.

Check in 2
I implemented core Sudoku solving logic using backtracking. I also added file input parsing, grid validation, and initial console output. 
I then tested 4x4 and 9x9 puzzles for correctness. Next steps I'm planning: improve formatting, add solution file output, and finalize documentation.

Check in 3: 
Finalized Sudoku solver: I added solution file writing, improved console output formatting, completed inline documentation, 
fixed a minor warning, and verified functionality.
